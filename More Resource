#### GitHub Desktop

You likely installed this before you started Git-it but if you didn't, here's the link.

The GitHub Desktop app lets you do much of what you can do in terminal (though not all) and is a bit easier to read at times. Personally, I use it to look over anything not small  `diff`  I have. Your changes are really nice to see this way.
